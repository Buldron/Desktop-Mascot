# What does it do?
It's simple software that gives you a desktop buddy to play with and enjoy! Currently, the features are limited. However, in the future it'll keep you company as it wanders about the desktop without interrupting your workflow. All this with the ability to easily edit how it interacts and looks by allowing a user to easily replace sprites and edit settings.

# Features
- Ability to quickly edit mascot via XML file.
- Ability to change mascots appearance by replacing sprites.
- Ability to throw around mascot.


### Latest update
**1.2.0**
- New animation class to support future animation state system.
- New XML reader class to handle getting all config settings.

# Next Planned Features.
